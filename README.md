## Introduction

Slime is a custom programming language designed for educational purposes. This interpreter is written in Go and aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform for experimenting with language design and interpreter implementation. As this project is a work in progress, new features and improvements are continuously being added.

## Features

Currently, the Slime Language Interpreter supports the following features:

- Basic lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Basic syntax parsing
- Error handling for invalid tokens

Planned features include:

- Full syntax parsing for a simple language grammar
- Evaluation of expressions and statements
- Support for variables and basic data types
- Control flow statements (if, while, for)
- Function definitions and calls

## Installation

To install the Slime Language Interpreter, you need to have Go installed on your system. You can clone the repository and build the project using the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slime
cd slime
go mod tidy**
